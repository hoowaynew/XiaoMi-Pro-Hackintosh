# ALC Plug Fix

To get your headphone jack working, please [dwnload](https://github.com/daliansky/XiaoMi-Pro/archive/master.zip) this repository, 
go in the `ALCPlugFix` folder and double click on `english_install.command`.

Wait while the script copy the required files (those files are in the `fix`) 
directory and flush your kext cache. It may takes a few seconds.

When it's done (you'll see `Press any key to Exit`), close the terminal and
restart your computer.

Your headphone jack should now work.

Please note that you may have to unplug/replug your headphones after every 
reboot.
