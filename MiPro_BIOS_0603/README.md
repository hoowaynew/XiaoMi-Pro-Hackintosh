# Update Your Xiaomi NoteBook Pro BIOS to Resolve Fan Noise

### Introduction
This BIOS packet is directly from Xiaomi stuff, so it is reliable.

Warning: Since it's a BIOS update, there's possibility that if some errors(such as force quit the update program) occur during the update process, the whole device may fail to boot.

If unfortunately this situation happens on you, you need to find Xiaomi stuff to fix your device. If you use this program, you should agree that you are the person who take whole responsibility, instead of me.

### How to Install

1. Download all the files in this BIOS folder.

2. Extract all the files and copy them to the root directory of a FAT32 U disk.

3. Restart your laptop and press `F12` botton to choose U disk to boot.
  - IMPORTANT: From this step, your computer should keep in charged by AC adapter until the whole update process finishes.

4. In the new shell interface, type `unlockme.nsh` and press `Enter`, then the system will automatically restart.

5. Repeat the third step, and this time type `flash.nsh`.

6. Wait until the update process ends.
